I have been learning ancient Greek.
Originally I jut wanted to read Marcus Aurelius,
but now I am just translating everything I can get my hands on.

Every morning I do a few lines of one of the Homeric Hymns.
As I complete them, I will upload them here.

All of my translations are released under the [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) licence.

I am uncertain as to the copyright of the original Greek.
In any case, the source material is all available [here](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus%3Acorpus%3Aperseus%2Cauthor%2CHomeric%20Hymns).
