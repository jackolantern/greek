# Εἲς Διώνυσον

... οἳ μὲν γὰρ Δρακάνῳ σ᾽, οἳ δ᾽ Ἰκάρῳ ἠνεμοέσσῃ 
φάσ᾽, οἳ δ᾽ ἐν Νάξῳ, δῖον γένος, εἰραφιῶτα, 
οἳ δέ σ᾽ ἐπ᾽ Ἀλφειῷ ποταμῷ βαθυδινήεντι 
κυσαμένην Σεμέλην τεκέειν Διὶ τερπικεραύνῳ: 
ἄλλοι δ᾽ ἐν Θήβῃσιν, ἄναξ, σε λέγουσι γενέσθαι, 
ψευδόμενοι: σὲ δ᾽ ἔτικτε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε 
πολλὸν ἀπ᾽ ἀνθρώπων, κρύπτων λευκώλενον Ἥρην. 
ἔστι δέ τις Νύση, ὕπατον ὄρος, ἀνθέον ὕλῃ, 
τηλοῦ Φοινίκης, σχεδὸν Αἰγύπτοιο ῥοάων, 

... καί οἱ ἀναστήσουσιν ἀγάλματα πόλλ᾽ ἐνὶ νηοῖς. 
ὣς δὲ τὰ μὲν τρία, σοὶ πάντως τριετηρίσιν αἰεὶ 
ἄνθρωποι ῥέξουσι τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας.


ἦ καὶ κυανέῃσιν ἐπ᾽ ὀφρύσι νεῦσε Κρονίων: 
ἀμβρόσιαι δ᾽ ἄρα χαῖται ἐπερρώσαντο ἄνακτος 
κρατὸς ἀπ᾽ ἀθανάτοιο: μέγαν δ᾽ ἐλέλιξεν Ὄλυμπον. 
ὣς εἰπὼν ἐπένευσε καρήατι μητίετα Ζεύς.


ἵληθ᾽, εἰραφιῶτα, γυναιμανές: οἱ δέ σ᾽ ἀοιδοὶ 
ᾁδομεν ἀρχόμενοι λήγοντές τ᾽: οὐδέ πῃ ἔστι 
σεῖ᾽ ἐπιληθομένῳ ἱερῆς μεμνῆσθαι ἀοιδῆς. 
καὶ σὺ μὲν οὕτω χαῖρε, Διώνυσ᾽ εἰραφιῶτα, 
σὺν μητρὶ Σεμέλῃ, ἥν περ καλέουσι Θυώνην.

# Hymn to Dionysus

... For it is claimed in Dracanum, but also windy Icarus,
but it is said in Naxos, a goat of heavenly kin,
but also on the deep eddys of the river Alpheus,
that pregnant Shmele bore you to Zeus the thunder-lover;
and others, lord, say you were born in Thebes.
Lies!  Your father took the shape of a man and brought you into being
far away from men, hidden from the white arms of Hera.
The summit of Nysa, the high mountain, of forests and flowers,
in the far country of Phoenicia, near the rivers of Egypt.

"... And many shrines will be raised to honor her and cut you up into three pieces
and since then every three years men shall complete her festival by the sacrifice of 100 oxen."

So the son of Kronos spoke, and nodded his dark browed head.
And the divine locks of the god flowed from his immortal head, and great Olympus was shaken.
So said the wise Zeus with a nod of his head.

Be gracious, goat, who makes women wild! We poets
begin and end our songs with you
and we do not forget your holy song.
Hail Dionysus, goat, with your mother Semele, called Thyone.

## Notes

### εἰραφιῶτα

This word is apparently difficult to translate.

My physical copy of Boer also gives the translation as "goat."

In summary these 
[notes](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0029%3Atext%3Dcomm%3Apoem%3D1)
state that:
* Evelyn-White translate it as "Insewn," a reference to Dionysus's origin myth.
* Allen and Sikes say it is a form of "σπαργανιῶτα" meaning swaddling clothes.
* Fick translates it as "goat."

I have decided to go with goat because I think it sounds rad.
It may not be the most faithful translation,
but I currently lack the skill to do any better.

### τερπικέραυνος

Evelyn-White translates this as thunder-lover,
and the double entendre is too good to pass up.
It seems the original meaning was probably something like
"Zeus, who thinks thunder is pretty neat."
