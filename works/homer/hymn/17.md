# Εἲς Διοσκούρους

Κάστορα καὶ Πολυδεύκἐ ἀείσεο, Μοῦσα λίγεια, 
Τυνδαρίδας, οἳ Ζηνὸς Ὀλυμπίου ἐξεγένοντο: 
τοὺς ὑπὸ Τηϋγέτου κορυφῇς τέκε πότνια Λήδη 
λάθρη ὑποδμηθεῖσα κελαινεφέι Κρονίωνι. 
χαίρετε, Τυνδαρίδαι, ταχέων ἐπιβήτορες ἵππων.

# Hymn to the Dioscuri

Of Castor and the Polydeuces the Muse sings clearly,
children of Tyndareus, born of Zeus of Olympus:
under the roof of Taygetus born to queen Leda,
secret lover of the black clouded son of Kronos.

Hail children of Tyndareus, swift riders of horses.

## Notes

### Children of Tyndareus

According to the myths,
at least Castor was the son of Zeus,
but Tyndareus raised both children as a step father.
They are therefore refered to also as the Tyndaridai, the children of Tyndareus.

### ὑποδμηθεῖσα

The Greek's had a word for a woman who had sex with a god: ὑποδμηθεῖσα.
A literal translation of this might be "raped by a god,"
because the word is clearly related to the verb "δαμάζω" which means to overpower.
However, it seems the Greeks also used the verb to refer to consensual sex as well:

Since I can find nothing in the myths of the Dioscuri to indicate that Leda was raped by Zeus,
I have chosen to translate ὑποδμηθεῖσα simply as "lover",
although "god-lover" might be a more faithful translation.

### Riders of Horses

The Dioscuri are associated with boxing, sailing, and horseback riding.
