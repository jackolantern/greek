Στοιχεῖα Εὐκλείδου α΄
=====================

Ὅροι κγ΄
--------

α´) Σημεῖόν ἐστιν, οὗ μέρος οὐθέν.

β΄) Γραμμὴ δὲ μῆκος ἀπλατές.

γ΄) Γραμμῆς δὲ πέρατα σημεῖα.

δ΄) Εὐθεῖα γραμμή ἐστιν, ἥτις ἐξ ἴσου τοῖς ἐφ' ἑαυτῆς σημείοις κεῖται.

---

1) A point is that which has no part.
2) A line is a breadthless length.
3) Line endings are points.
4) A straight line is equal to the points which lie on it.

In definition `1` the word usually translated as *point* is *Σημεῖόν*, which is elsewhere (for example in the New Testament) translated as *sign* or even *miracle*.

Definition `3` is hard to translate in such a way as to respect the plurality of all of the terms.  This may just be because I don't fully understand how plurals work.
